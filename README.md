# Financial Fraud Detection EDA

A comprehensive exploratory data analysis of synthetic financial transaction data to identify patterns and characteristics of fraudulent activities.

## üìä Project Overview

This project analyzes a synthetic financial dataset containing 636,620 transactions to understand fraud patterns and improve detection capabilities. The analysis focuses on transaction types, amounts, timing, and balance changes to reveal key insights about fraudulent behavior.

## üóÇÔ∏è Dataset Information

- **Total Transactions**: 636,620
- **Features**: 11 columns
- **Target Variable**: `isFlagged` (fraud indicator)
- **Transaction Types**: CASH_OUT, PAYMENT, CASH_IN, TRANSFER, DEBIT
- **Time Range**: Sequential steps (1-743)

### Dataset Schema
```
- step: Transaction sequence number
- type: Transaction type (CASH_OUT, PAYMENT, CASH_IN, TRANSFER, DEBIT)
- amount: Transaction amount
- nameOrig: Origin account identifier
- oldbalanceOrg: Origin account balance before transaction
- newbalanceOrig: Origin account balance after transaction
- nameDest: Destination account identifier
- oldbalanceDest: Destination account balance before transaction
- newbalanceDest: Destination account balance after transaction
- isFraud: Actual fraud label (ground truth)
- isFlagged: Fraud detection system flag
```
